# SHR Data Dictionary Export

The Standard Health Record (SHR) initiative is working to create a single, high-quality health record for every individual in the United States.  For more information, see [standardhealthrecord.org](http://standardhealthrecord.org/).

This GitHub repository contains an ES6 library for exporting an Excel workbook data dictionary representing the SHR.

The SHR text definitions and grammar files can be found in the [shr_spec](https://github.com/standardhealth/shr_spec) repo.  As the SHR text format (and content files) are still evolving, so is this library.

# Setting Up the Environment

This project is being developed with Node.js 8.x (the current LTS version), although other versions _may_ work.  After installing Node.js and Yarn, change to the project directory and _yarn install_ the dependencies:
```
